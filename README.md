# snowflake-sagemaker-poc
repo to hold modified files from snowflake sagemaker integration repo - to work with cleardata
original repo and info is found in the doc here: https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/vhol_snowflake_data_wrangler/index.html#1
but, because it tried to create a role, it fails in the cleardata environment because it doesn't add the cleardata_boundary policy.
